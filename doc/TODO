There are still quite a lot of features we could
add to BC UpdateCache extension.

A few users of BC UpdateCache may require further
extension of the solution and related features.

Features for consideration:

- Add command line script to generate as well
- Add workflow events to clear caches and update them
- Refactor / refine functionality associated with cache generation
  into a more reusable and user friendly solution to allow for
  simpler reuse of the surrounding functionality provided by this extension
- Add custom admin menu templates linking object id to
  a custom module view to generate the related cache on
  demand for a given object ID and redirect back to the
  referring page / object primary node in admin, etc ...
- Expand execution limitation of one role id to many role ids
- Move away from ini settings to module policies
- Updated look and design in templates
